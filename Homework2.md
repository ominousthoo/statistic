## Introduction
In the class of the second lecture about the Regression in econometrics model, the lecturer has introduced the variance-bias tradeoff between the low-degree polynomial and high-degree polynomial model. The variance-bias tradeoff is explaining that if the regression model is more simple, they will be tend to have a high level of bias and lower level of variance. Thus, if we increase the complexity of the model by increasing the degree of variables in the polynomial model, the bias of the estimator might reduce but the level of variance will be going to increase sharply.<br/>
The Data Analysis will be run in `R Studio` and the data using will be generated randomly using `R`.<br/>
The study will shows the difference of bias and variance between different degree of polynomial model.<br/>

## Data Description
In this study, the sample data (xi,yi) will be generated randomly through `R Studio`. Variable `xi` will be generated randomly by following uniform distribution between minimum value of `1` and maximum value of `100`. The variable `yi` will be generated as normal distribution with the mean `log(x)` and standard deviation = `1.2`. <br/>
The code and the fucntion below shows the process of generating data.<br/>
``` r
#define the function of generating data
f <- function(x){
  log(x)
}
#generating data at sample size of 150, x values between range 1 to 100
#y values follow normal distribution with mean = log(x) and standard deviation = 1.2 
gen_data_func <- function(f,size=150) {
  x <- runif(size,min=1,max=100)
  y <- rnorm(size,f(x),1.2)
  data.frame(x,y)
}
#use set.seed for reproducibility of the data
set.seed(112233)
data1=gen_data_func(f)
#view and check the reliability of data
View(data1)
```
After generating the data we have to use later in the data analysis, let us check the data we just generated by illustrating them with a ScatterPlot Diagram and fitted line. In the ScatterPlot Diagram below, a linear fitted line and lowess fitted line have been used to compare the difference. The ScatterPlot has been generated by using the codes below in `R Studio`.
``` r
#plot both the data point x and y in the scatter plot
plot(y~x, data=data1, main="Scatter Plot", 
     xlab="x",ylab="y",pch=19)
#create a legend to show the linear fitted line and lowess line
legend("bottomright", 
       c("Linear","Lowess"), 
       col = c("red","blue"), lwd = 2,cex=0.75)
#draw the linear fitted line and lowess line in the graph
abline(lm(y~x,data=data1),col="red")
lines(lowess(data1$x,data1$y),col="blue")
```
The data point of `x` and `y` has been shown using scatterplot below.<br/>

From the ScatterPlot Diagram above we can see that the generated data point are scattering around but the linear fitted line and lowess line are still roughly showing us the shape of the line which `y=log(x)` should have even it is not really obvious.<br/>
## Data Analysis and Simulation
After generating the data set which we have to use in the simulation, now we have to generate a few polynomial regression model with different degree in order to compare the differences of the bias and variance of their estimator accordingly. In this study, I will be going to simulate by using four different degree of polynomial model which is degree 1, degree 2, degree 5 and degree 10. The process of generating polynomial model is using the codes below.
``` r
#4 polynomial regression model has been generated on different degree
reg1=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 1), data=data1)
reg2=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 2), data=data1)
reg3=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 5), data=data1)
reg4=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 10), data=data1)
```
After generating the polynomial regression model, all polynomial model has been ran and the regression line has been plotted onto the ScatterPlot Diagram in order to compare the differences between the regression line of different degree. The real line which is `y=log(x)` will be plotted as black solid line for comparison purpose in the graph.<br/>
The Graph of Regression Line is generated by using the codes below by using `R Studio`.
``` r
#use set.seed for reproducibility of the data
set.seed(123)
#create the scatter plot as the base of the graph for regression lines
plot(y ~ x, data = data1, col = "grey", pch = 20,
     main = "Regression Line Between Different Degree")
grid()
#create a suitable scale for the x-axis
grid = seq(from =0 , to = 100, by = 1)
lines(grid, f(grid), col = "black", lwd = 1)#real regression line
#regression line for different degree of polynomial model
lines(grid, predict(reg1, newdata = data.frame(x = grid)), col = "green",  lwd = 2,lty = 2)
lines(grid, predict(reg2, newdata = data.frame(x = grid)), col = "636",   lwd = 2, lty =3)
lines(grid, predict(reg3, newdata = data.frame(x = grid)), col = "654", lwd = 2, lty = 4)
lines(grid, predict(reg4, newdata = data.frame(x = grid)), col = "367",  lwd = 2, lty = 5)
#create a legend to show clearer about the regression line
legend("bottomright", 
       c("degree of 1","degree of 2","degree of 5","degree of 10", "real"), 
       col = c("green", "636", "654", "367", "black"), lty = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 1), lwd = 2,cex=0.75)
```

After illustrating the regression line above, the next step is to create a matrix of estimation for the different model in order to calculate and compare the bias, variance and mean square error of the estimator between the polynomial model with different degree. In this simulation, the value of `x = 20` has been picked in order to measure and compare the performance between different polynomial model. For the real situation, `log(20)` will be equal to `2.996` and this will be used to measure the performance of the polynomial model by measuring how far was the estimation of the model is from the real result which is `2.996`. Thus, the codes will be shown below.
``` r
set.seed(112233) #use set.seed for reproducibility of the data
nrun <- 200 #calculate for 200 estimation in each model
nreg <- 4 #total 4 model has been build
x <- data.frame(x=20) #this will be the real data to be measured
#log(20) = 2.996
estm = matrix(0,nrow=nrun,ncol=nreg) # create a matrix with 4 columns
for (sam in 1:nrun){                 #and 200 rows to store the generated data
  data1 = gen_data_func(f)
  reg1=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 1), data=data1)
  reg2=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 2), data=data1)
  reg3=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 5), data=data1)
  reg4=lm(y~poly(x,degree = 10), data=data1)
  
  estm[sam,1]=predict(reg1,x) #fill the matrix with the estimation
  estm[sam,2]=predict(reg2,x)
  estm[sam,3]=predict(reg3,x)
  estm[sam,4]=predict(reg4,x)
}
```
